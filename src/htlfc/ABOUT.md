Hypertext Legacy File Converter "HTLFC" converts the following file types into a single `.html` file:

* `.maff` - Mozilla Archive File Format, as produced by the Firefox extension of the same name.
* `.mht` - MIME Hypertext.
* `.war` - Web ARchive as produced by the KDE Konqueror web browser (other sources of `.war` files have not been tested).
* `file+dir` - web page saved as *filename*.html plus *filename_files/* directory (the native "Save As" format provided by Firefox and Chrome).

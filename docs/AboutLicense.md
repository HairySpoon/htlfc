# About License
Hypertext Legacy File Converter "HTLFC" is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 "AGPLv3".  A copy is provided in the root directory of the project tree in the file `LICENSE`.

## Rationale
HTLFC is file conversion software that could be used to provide Software as a Service "SaaS".  AGPLv3 requires that any SaaS using the licensed software, also makes the source code available.

## Intent
AGPLv3 has been applied to HTLFC, not to discourage provision through SaaS, but to reveal to the end user, that an option exists to acquire and run the application directly.

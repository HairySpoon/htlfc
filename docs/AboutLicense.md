# About License
Hypertext Legacy File Converter "HTLFC" is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 "AGPLv3".  A copy is provided in the root directory of the source tree in the file LICENSE.

## Rationale
HTLFC is file conversion software that could be used to provide Software as a Service "SaaS".  AGPLv3 requires that any SaaS using the licensed software, also makes the source code available.

## Intent
AGPLv3 has been applied to HTLFC, not to discourage provision of SaaS, but to inform the end user that an option exists to acquire and run the application directly.
